      <description>Database trigger is an event that can occur after or before a statement is executed or a row is modified / inserted / deleted. This can be used to perform any task before or after certain occurrence of an event in the database.
I was curious about this concept from a very long time and wanted to check it out.
I wanted to try an automation by creating a trigger function.</description>
