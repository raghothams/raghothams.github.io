      <description>In the previous post, we spoke about why Nischal and I started Fontastic as a side project. However, a year down the line, we realized there were major learnings for us while working on the project and this could be useful to many others as well. Hence, we decided to share our learnings through a series of posts and we start with data acquistion as our first story.
In this post we cover the various data acquisition strategies we had to experiment and their pros and cons.</description>

      <description>2016, It was a sunny morning in London, Nischal &amp;amp; I were roaming around the Westminster Bridge.
We were speaking at PyData London that year and the topic was Deep Learning
Of all the things, there was this one thing we were super curious to know — Which is the font on the boards of the buses?

This was one of the most legible, crisp, clean font we had ever seen!</description>
