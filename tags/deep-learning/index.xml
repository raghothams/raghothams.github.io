      <description>2016, It was a sunny morning in London, Nischal &amp;amp; I were roaming around the Westminster Bridge.
We were speaking at PyData London that year and the topic was Deep Learning
Of all the things, there was this one thing we were super curious to know — Which is the font on the boards of the buses?

This was one of the most legible, crisp, clean font we had ever seen!</description>

      <description>Word embedding is a technique of converting words to vectors of a high dimension space. In simple terms, in each dimension, we group words based on a particular aspect — gender, colour etc., and score the words based on similarity in that space.
 For example — “I have a red car, maroon shirt and a grey bicycle”
 One of the dimensions can represent colour. Red, maroon and grey are assigned similar scores.</description>
